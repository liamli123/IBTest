# ib_insync: High-level, Pythonic wrapper around the official IB API.
# It handles the async event loop, connection management, and provides
# a much simpler interface than the raw ibapi.
ib_insync>=0.9.86

# The official IB API (ibapi) is bundled inside ib_insync,
# so you do NOT need to install it separately.
# If you ever need the raw API:
#   pip install ibapi
